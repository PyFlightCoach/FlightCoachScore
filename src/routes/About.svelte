		FCScore is the first public release of an automatic judging process which has been in
		development for over 10 years. The application is free to use for flight data recorded in <a
			href="https://ardupilot.org/">Ardupilot</a
		>
		dataflash log files and <a href="https://www.flightcoach.org/">Flight Coach</a> JSON files. The automatic
		judging process is entirely deterministic based on the rules for the relevant aerobatic category,
		allowing you to see exactly how every score is calculated and hence how to improve your flying.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alongside the judging process, FCScore includes a flight data and score sharing platform. This
		means that FCScore offers the new possiblity of registering world records in aerobatics. We
		encourage all pilots to share as many flights as possible as we can use this to improve the
		judging process in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		FCScore is still under active development, but it is already producing compelling results for
		F3A aerobatic flights. Initial trials have been performed for full-scale power and glider
		aerobatics and preliminary support for IMAC will be added soon. Future work will also include
		closer integration with the Flight Coach plotter.
