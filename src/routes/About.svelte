  FCScore is the first public release of an automatic judging process which has been in development for over 10 years. 
  The application is free to use for flight data recorded in Ardupilot dataflash log files and Flight Coach JSON files. 
  The automatic judging process is entirely deterministic based on the rules for the relevant aerobatic category, allowing
  you to see exactly how every score is calculated and hence how to improve.

  Alongside the judging process, FCScore includes a flight data and score sharing platform. This means that FCScore offers 
  the new possiblity of registering world records in aerobatics. We encourage all pilots to share as many flights as possible 
  as we can use this to improve the judging process in the future.

  FCScore is still under active development, but it is already producing compelling results for F3A aerobatic flights,
  iniitlal trials have been performed for full-scale power and glider aerobatics and preliminary support for IMAC will be
  added soon. Future work will also include closer integration with the Flight Coach plotter.
